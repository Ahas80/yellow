# Current VF provenance map

This file's location is retained for links, but its content describes only the active Longcycler-only operational-phenotype release.

## Provenance rule

A VF row is publishable only when its participant-timepoint key and selected FASTA content hash remain within the analytical manifest.

## Audited release contract

- Scope: Longcycler-only selected QC-passing assemblies; one selected assembly per analytical episode.
- Clinical definition: operational UTI phenotype. It is a versioned culture-plus-compatible-symptom rule, not a reconstruction of the full published protocol.
- Analytical cohort: 532/161/16/516 (episodes/residents/operational UTI/operational Not_UTI).
- Direct evidence: 893 all within-resident pairs.
- Adjacent evidence: 371/139/140 (pairs/residents/pairs at or below 25 SNP).
- Focused transitions: 9 Not_UTI -> UTI; 5/9 at or below 25 SNP.
- Mechanism casebook: 9/9/0 (cases/linked/missing).
- Near-miss audit: 17 rows; these are not operational UTI cases.
- Attrition/QC context only: 583/166/18/565 (full-source episodes/residents/operational UTI/operational Not_UTI); these are not analytical denominators.
- Research-question boundary: RQ01-RQ10 only.
- Interpretation: exploratory, observational and non-causal.

## Methods fixed by the registry

- Operational phenotype: culture lower bound >=1,000 CFU/mL plus compatible symptoms under the versioned rule.
- Assembly QC: <=200 contigs, N50 >=20,000 bp and genome size 4,000,000-6,000,000 bp; read coverage, completeness and contamination are excluded metrics.
- VF calls: ABRicate with VFDB at >=80% identity and >=80% coverage, SHA-bound to the selected Longcycler FASTA manifest.
- MLST: lineage context only; provider calls require >=95% good targets. Policy: provider_qc95 call key/path-linked to the selected Longcycler episode; local fallback excluded. When required, local calls are labelled and use the same selected FASTA.
- Pair-specific evidence: dnadiff is primary, with an operational threshold of <=25 SNP; MLST or graph context cannot overrule a conflicting direct pair.
- Population context: Parsnp core-genome and Panaroo pangenome outputs provide context, not pair-specific continuity proof.
